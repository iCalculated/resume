  title: Hack the North 2023
  info:
  - Created an extension to allow mouse control via gaze prediction without specialized hardware—an open research problem.
  - Designed a real-time pipeline that predicted pose, applied a CNN for dynamics then refined predictions via saliency mapping.
  - Planned to deploy everything to edge via WASM. That went poorly (but was somewhat enlightening)!
